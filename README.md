## OllieJS
A Javascript API for Sphero (Orbotix) Ollie (a working one).

API is able get messages from Ollie, parse them (thank you alchemycs), send commands to Ollie (with a maximum latency of 10 ms ('colors.js' example) with the crappy bluetooth dongle of my laptop :D ).

Check out the [controller](https://github.com/omeryagmurlu/ollie-controller) I wrote for Ollie with this SDK
